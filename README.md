Use Phalcon and {JSON:API} to make your own server

This project demonstrates how to use the [Phalcon + {JSON:API}](https://github.com/gte451f/phalcon-json-api-package) project. 
It is a working example that pulls a the composer package into a Phalcon application. 
The demo app is backed by a sqlite database but MySQL or MariaDB also work well.
